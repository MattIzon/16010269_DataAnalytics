DBROW Data Analytics on the Web

Methodology to produce datasets is in the root folder in number order

Initial data is in the data folder

All LR data / models are in LR folder:
CC_Normalised_Per_Year contains the first models and data prior to normalising everything - The model and its data share the same number.
All_Normalised_Whole contains the generic and test data and fully normalised models. The colab files should just run and include tests.
Districts contains district models and data. Again the model files should just run including test.

DNN contains all DNN models and data.
Model 1 - Districts Normalised
Model 2 - Districts No Normalisation
Model 3 - Districts Layers Experiment
Model 4 - No Districts
Model 5 - No Districts Layers Experiment

TensorFlow V1 is no longer compatible in colab, so I had to figure out V2 compatible models.

I renamed some folders, so had to change the file imports. I think I have fixed them all but its possible I may have overlooked some.
